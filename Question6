# Question 6
# Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer and then prints
# out that many lines. In the program, write a function that takes a 
# positive integer n, and the produces n lines of output. The first line 
# contains one dollar sign, the second two dollar signs, until the last line, 
# which should have n dollar signs. Hint: What does the expression “$” * 5 do?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# hint: What does the expression “$” * 5 do?
# creates a string that repeats the character $ 5 times. * used for repetition
# print out the # lines according to the + integer input by user


def print_dollar_billz_yall(x):  
 for i in range(1, x+1):
  print("$"*i)
# define function dollarbillzyall which takes positive integer x
# as the argument, and produces x lines of output using for loop/print. 
# for each loop iteration, prints string of $ repeated i times, where i is the loop
# variable (ranging from 1 to x) 

# prompts user to enter the positive integer
x = int(input("Enter a positive integer here: "))

# print result of function for x input 
print_dollar_billz_yall(x)
